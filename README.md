# pull-request-branch
- example showing version control for 201 project

### Command Line Process
1. git clone git@github.com:j-hertzog/pull-request-branch.git
2. cd pull-request-branch
3. use 'git branch' to show you that your on the main branch
4. create a new branch off of main
   > git checkout -b "newbranchname" 
5. make your desired changes here, modify, create, delete, etc...
6. add and commit your changes
   > git add .  
   > git commit -m "Your message of the changes" 
7. push to your local branch
  - it will give you the -set--upstream response, just copy and paste the command they give you
8. From here you can make your pull request with the main branch

### Other helpful tips
- make sure you are pulling often to make sure your local code is up to date with the repository.
- pushing to your local branch often is safe and important because it lets us checkout to your branch if you need help with debugging or anything. 
- in reality we only have to do this after we merge with main, so I can send out a message after we merge.
